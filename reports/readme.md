Here you can find the literature and thesis report. Many hours were spend reading academic papers, writing, rewriting, processing feedback and re-rewriting text. I want you to know that I hated every minute of it. Perhaps it was the awareness that no one will ever willingly read these reports. Maybe it is my mind, that has the habit of wandering off at every sentence produced. Unfortunately, working on such literature is a efficient method to squeeze out all motivation and leaves one soullessly staring at a screen in record time. It is a soul sucking feeling of mental exhaustion that cannot be tamed by rivers of coffee, the stress of an upcoming deadline or the negligible payoff of the occasional well written tencences. It is hours and hours of marching sentences from a sour start to a bitter end. Will this sentece end in a point, or simply continue after a comma? Please, can there already be a point? Will there be a point? What is the point...
